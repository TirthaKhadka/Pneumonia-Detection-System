# Pneumonia-Detection-System
📌 Pneumonia Detection System

This project is a deep learning-based medical diagnostic tool designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze radiographs and provide accurate predictions, assisting healthcare professionals in early disease identification.

🔹 Features

Preprocessing of chest X-ray datasets (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

CNN-based pneumonia classification (Normal vs. Pneumonia).

Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

User-friendly interface for uploading X-ray images and viewing predictions.

Scalable and adaptable for deployment in real-world medical settings.

🔹 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas

Flask / Streamlit (for deployment)

🔹 Dataset

The model is trained and tested using publicly available Chest X-Ray datasets (e.g., Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset
).

🔹 Applications

Assisting radiologists in medical diagnosis.

Deployable as a web app or mobile app for hospitals and clinics.

Research and academic purposes in healthcare AI.
